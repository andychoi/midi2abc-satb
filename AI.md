Beyond what we’ve built, here are a few **next-level arrangement/“style advisor”** features you might layer on top of your current analyzer:

1. **Motivic Development & Variation**

   * **Detect** recurring short motifs in any part.
   * **Generate** simple transpositions, inversions, retrogrades or sequence-based imitations in other voices (e.g. Alto picks up a 2-bar Soprano motive up a 3rd).
   * **Tool idea:** scan each part for interval-patterns, then auto-produce 2–3 “motivic answers” and embed ABC examples.

2. **Dynamic & Articulation Mapping**

   * **Segment** the score into phrases (e.g. look for cadential harmonies or long rests).
   * **Suggest** crescendo/diminuendo ranges or slur vs. staccato markings based on phrase shape and note-density.
   * **Tool idea:** compute per-phrase “density curve” and map the top 20% to a crescendo marking in ABC (`!cres!`) or MusicXML `<dynamics>`.

3. **Timbre & Orchestration Advice**

   * **Analyze** register overlaps (e.g. soprano line doubling violin at unison vs. octave).
   * **Recommend** idiomatic doublings or divisi passages—for instance, split cello into two staves for a lush lower-voice pad.
   * **Tool idea:** flag when two parts occupy the same octave for >4 measures and suggest alternate doubling (e.g. shift piano left-hand down an octave).

4. **Tension–Release Curve Modeling**

   * **Compute** a “tension score” per measure (e.g. dissonance weight + harmonic rhythm speed + melodic contour leaps).
   * **Visualize** a tension vs. time graph to show where you might want a bigger climax or a breathing spot.
   * **Tool idea:** produce a small chart (using matplotlib) and embed it in the HTML so you can actually see your piece’s emotional arc.

5. **Harmonic-Rhythm Variation**

   * **Detect** uniform quarter-note harmonic changes (block chords on every bar) and **suggest** variations (hold a chord 2 bars then accelerate, or subdivide into 8th-note arpeggios).
   * **Tool idea:** list measures where chords change in strict syncopation and propose an ABC snippet that holds or subdivides.

6. **AI-Driven Style Transfer**

   * **Train or prompt** on a small chorale/ensemble corpus (Bach, French Romantic, modern jazz).
   * **Propose** 1–2 alternate reharmonizations or voice-leadings “in the style of” your chosen model.
   * **Tool idea:** integrate with a cloud LLM or on-device model that outputs ABC or MusicXML fragments.

If any of these jump out, I can help prototype the code:

* **Motivic variation generator**
* **Phrase-based dynamic/articulation advisor**
* **Tension curve plotting**
* **Harmonic-rhythm variation proposals**
* **Orchestration-idiom checker**
* **Style-transfer reharmonizer**
